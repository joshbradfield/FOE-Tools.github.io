More the level of the Arc is high, more the reward are important.\n\nThat's how we started talking about 1.8, 1.9, etc. In reality, this is the Arc bonus.\nIn fact, 1.0 represents the basic reward, 1.8 represents the reward with an Arc level 70 (it gives 80% more reward at that level) and 1.9 represents the reward with an Arc level 80 (90% more reward).\n\nThreads exclusively reserved for this type of investment were created in guilds and groups of friends. This is based on the principle of \"I give what I get\", thus limiting conflicts between guild members or friends by not making profits on their GBs. Unlike endless threads (10, 50, 100, etc.), the other advantage of 1.8, 1.9, etc. threads is that it saves a considerable amount of time for the GB owner. This is because the owner only needs to put in the necessary number of FPs to secure places that are going to be taken by level 80 Arcs (in the case of thread 1.9).\n\nLet's take an example:\n\nLet's imagine that you want to raise your $t(foe_data.gb.Observatory) from level 10 to 60 and that you earn $t(utils.FP, {'count': 50 }) per day.\nThe total cost of the levels is $t(utils.FP, {'count': 64975 }).\n\nIf you are using endless threads, your investment will be 1:1, i.e. $t(utils.FP, {'count': 25 }) invested on a GB = $t(utils.FP, {'count': 25 }) that another player will invest on your GB. So you will have to <strong>invest $t(utils.FP, {'count': 37320 })</strong> to reach level 60. At $t(utils.FP, {'count': 50 }) per day, it will take you <strong>2 years and 17 days</strong>.\n\nNow, if you use a 1.9 thread, you will have to <strong>only invest $t(utils.FP, {'count': 12363 })</strong> to reach level 60, so <strong>a saving of $t(utils.FP, {'count': 24957 }) !</strong>.\nStill with $t(utils.FP, {'count': 50 }) per day, you go from 2 years and 17 days to <strong>8 months and 5 days</strong> !"

The expected investment at 1.9 is $t(utils.FP, {'count': 1739 }). A sniper (with an Arc level 80) could wait until the level opens to take his place directly and put $t(utils.FP, {'count': 1679 }), which would secure his place and make a profit of $t(utils.FP, {'count': 60 })."
